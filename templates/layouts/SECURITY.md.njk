# üõ°Ô∏è Security Policy

{% block security_policy -%}
If you discover a critical security vulnerability, **do not** open an issue on GitHub.

{% if repo.vul_rep_enabled -%}
	Instead, please [report the vulnerability privately]({{- repo.html_url -}}/security) so I have an opportunity to fix the issue before it is publicly disclosed.
{%- else -%}
	Instead, please send me a message directly at [${contactUrl}](https://${contactUrl}) so I have an opportunity to fix the issue before it is publicly disclosed.
{%- endif -%}
